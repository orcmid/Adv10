Adventure Version 1.0: The Original Colossal Cave Text Adventure

Adv10 provides a "Clean C" port of the Original Colossal Cave Text Adventure.  The initial objective is a command-line version that operates the same as the original.

The starter (Adv10 1.0.0) is based on the Literate Programming version provided by Donald E. Knuth in Chapter 27 of his book, "Selected Paopers on Fun & Games."
The source code has been downloaded and is being morphed into a new set of files that are keyed back to the Literate Programming sections.
