                        ADV10 WINCON DERIVATION STAGING
                        ===============================

    The Adv10/dev/WinCon Construction Set is a customization of an nfoTools
    WinConKit.  Customizations are made here and then promoted to the WinCon
    folder for stable use until an update is required.
    
    An update can be because of a need to change something in the Adv10Build
    procedure.  It could also be for incorporating updates to the WinConKit
    that the Adv10/dev/WinCon Construction Set is based on.
    
    The WinCon components customized here can be operated for testing and
    confirmation.  The one difference is adjustment for the relative 
    path to the Adv10/src files being longer than from the Adv10/dev/WinCon 
    folder.
    
    Having customization separated out into this subordinate folder serves
    three objectives.
    
      1. Having testing and confirmation of a new customization without
         disturbing the current working WinCon procedure.
         
      2. Having the customizations in the open and under source-code management
         even for files that are delivered to the WinCon construction set only
         as part of Zip packages.
         
      3. Serving as a laboratory for piloting of nfoTools WinConKit provisions
         that are incorporated in WinConKits and then brought back as if
         new, confirming that too.

   
    
PREREQUISITES

    
    
DEPENDENCIES

  * Visual C command-line compiler, cl.exe, and its libraries for building
    standard C/C++ on a Microsoft Windows PC.
    
    It is sufficient to obtain and install a free version of Microsoft Visual
    Studio or Microsoft Visual C.  For suggestions of versions that adv10 is
    tested with, see <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101b.htm>.
      
   
MANIFEST

    .gitignore (customized from WinConKit .gitignore)
        Ignoring folders that are created only for construction activity
        and not intended as part of the distributed source codes.  This
        prevents local customizations of working material from infecting
        the shared public source-code tree on GitHub.

    devAdv10WinCon.txt
        This description file on organization of the customization area
        and use of its materials.
        
    Adv10Run.bat (customized from WinConRun.bat)
        Script for running a built Adv10.exe.  If Adv10.exe has not yet been
        built successfully, building will be attempted.
        
    Adv10Built.bat (customized from WinConBuilt.bat)
        Script for ensuring that Adv10 has been built successfully and, if 
        not, attempting to build it.
                      
    VCensure.bat (via WinConKit)
        script for confirming that the current session is set up for using
        the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and other command-line tools.
        VCensure will set up the VC++ command-line environment if it is not
        already established.      
        
    Adv10Build.zip (created from customized components)
        Experimental build component to confirm compilation and the intended
        next link in this construct-set tool chain.  Extract to Adv10Build\  
        
    Adv10Build.txt (customized from the WinConKit WinConBuild.txt)
        part of Adv10Build.zip
    
    Adv10Build.bat (customized from the WinConKit WinConBuilt.bat)
        part of Adv10Build.zip
        
    Adv10Build.opt (customized from WinConBuild.opt)
        Command-line options for the compilation of Adv10 source code.
        part of Adv10Build.zip used by Adv10Build.bat
        
    Adv10Sources.opt (customized from WinConSources.opt)
        Command-line option specifying the relative path to the sources
        part of Adv10Build.zip used by Adv10Build.bat
 
    VCbind.zip (via WinConKit)
        package which provides the VC++ command-line setup script when 
        extracted to VCbind\ here.
        
    VCbind-0.2.0.txt (via WinConKit)
        manifest and instructions from VCbind.zip available for review
        before extracting VCbind.zip.  Useful for becoming more involved
        in details of the construction and command-line configuration
        options.

TODO

 * Get the :USAGE working properly in Adv10Build.bat
 
 * Get the :USAGE working properly in Adv10Built.bat
 
 * Introduce Adv10Run.bat
 
 * The deployed Adv10.exe will also be run from an Adv10.bat file that
   brings up a standalone session for running Adv10.exe.  To keep it 
   from being deleted on a clean, it needs a different name if included
   in Adv10Build.bat.  Maybe Adv10Con.bat.  Some experimentation is 
   called for.  

 * Note that the .gitignore makes it unnecessary to exclude the individual
   types of artifacts.  We exclude everything that is extracted into one of
   the ignored folders.
   
 * There needs to be a special note about how the Adv10Sources.opt is changed
   in a WinCon\devWinConKit\Adv10Build\ extraction of Adv10Build.zip.  That
   extraction is one directory deeper than it is when extracted at WinCon.
   In devAdv10WinCon and Adv10Build.zip, the .opt file is correct for 
   WinCon\Adv10Build.zip

 * Develop a pilot customized Adv10 WinCon here and back-port it to the
   nfoTools/devKits/WinConKit/devWinConKit.  Then we confirm by bringing the 
   WinConKit back and customizing it.  
   
 * Piloting can happen a second time, and used to prime a new devWinConKit
   activity.  Then we get to see how updating an existing WinCon will work
   out.

 * This is part of the Adv10 source tree and is not designed to be spun out
   or made distributable.  This does serve as a worked example of a 
   customization though.  
   
 * There may be some interesting challenges in how the transformations arise
   after expanding a WinConKit here, and also what happens with regard to
   upgrading to a later WinConKit, if necessary.

 * Expand the manifest for what will appear in this folder.  

 * The Adv10Build.zip needs an Adv10Build.txt.  Maybe.  If so, it is created
   here.
 
 * Working on this is more-advanced than simply using Adv10/dev/WinCon and
   doing any local customizations of the WinCon/VCbind and WinCon/Adv10Build
   folders, so we maybe don't have to be quite so tutorial about all of it.
   Not at first in any case.
 
 * The prerequisites and dependencies are the same as for the Adv10/dev/WinCon,
   so they don't have to be repeated here.
 
 * Add something about customizing and verifying a new/updated WinCon
   and then using the result to build Adv10 until a change is needed.
 
 * Add information about how the customizations occur here, can be confirmed,
   and are then elevated to Adv10/dev/WinCon/ for stable use.
