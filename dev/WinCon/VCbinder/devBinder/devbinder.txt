                            VCBINDER SOURCE CODE
                            ====================

    This folder provides the files and the procedure for composing
    a VCbinder.zip release.

MANIFEST

    .gitignore
        preventing any devbinder/VCbind/ and VCbinder/ working folders from
        being integrated in the source-code version control; included in 
        VCbinder.zip for the same purpose.
        
    VCbinder.txt
        The manifest and procedure file that is incorporated in VCbinder.zip
        and also works as a description at an integration point.
               
    VCbind.bat
        VCbinder script used as a relay to its extracted counterpart in
        VCbind.zip after checking that everything is where it is expected
        to be.
        
    VCbind.txt
         copy of the same file in VCbind.zip so that it can be read before
         any VCbind.zip extraction, as may be desired.
         
    VCbind.zip
         The version of the VCbind procedure that is delivered in the 
         current VCbinder
         
    VCbinder.zip
          The current VCbinder artifact for integration of VCbind elements
          into the source-code version-control of a construction set.

   superior VCbinder/ folder.
   
 * Replace the placeholder files with ones from the companion VCbind/
   construction.
