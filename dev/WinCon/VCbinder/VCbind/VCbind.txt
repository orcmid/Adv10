TODO

  * The only reason for this folder is to avoid a conflict with the 
    VCbind.txt file that goes into VCbind.zip and a VCbind.txt file that
    is part of the construction structure of a VCbind/ directory other
    than the one created by extraction of VCbind.zip into a VCbind/ folder.
    
  * It seems this is easier to handle by bringing dev/ up one level with a
    new name, like devBind.  (devBinder would be an appropriate companion
    choice then.)
    
  * It would be handy to decrease the hierarchy in this manner, especially
    since our main purpose is to deploy via VCbinder.zip.
