          CREATE VCBIND FOR VISUAL C/C++ COMMAND-LINE DEVELOPMENT
          =======================================================
          
                   PROVISIONAL DEVELOPMENT SOURCE CODE
                   -----------------------------------

            VCbinder/ is the source tree for development and derivation
            of VCbind.zip versions.  Provisional inclusion as part of the
            Adv10 source tree is for proof-of-concept, demonstration, and
            hardening purposes.  
            
            Technically, this is an independent project.  It is not
            specific to Adv10.  
        
            VCbinder will eventually be relocated to a  separate source-
            code project for reusable utilities that are valuabie in a
            variety of development projects that include command-line
            construction sets that employ Microsoft development tools. At
            that point, VCbind.zip packages will provide a link to that 
            maintained source for additional information and the latest
            version.
                  
          
    VCbind.zip is a drop-in package that can be redistributed as part of
    a source-code construction set.  Extracting VCbind.zip provides
    a folder and helper script, VCbind.bat.  Running the script
    adjusts a Windows console session for command-line operation of
    the Microsoft Visual C compiler and related Microsoft development
    tools.  
    
    The extracted script allows console session-development without
    depending on the Visual Studio (or any other) Integrated Development
    Environment (IDE), even though the tools are commonly installed as
    part of freely-available versions of Visual Studio.

TODO

 * Scavenge VC.txt 0.03 from ShowDefs/VC for anything useful here.

 * Figure out how to separate test running of VCBind under here is 
   separated or not from the maintained source.  Maybe not?  So the
   VCBind subfolder here is the source for VCBind.exe and reverting it
   depends on re-extraction?
   
 * Adapt the ShowDefs experimental versions to the VCBinder structure as
   the development source for VCBind.zip redistributables.

 * Verify the structure with cmd.exe, PowerShell, TC, and MSYS2 (POSIX)
   shells and possibly CYGWIN.  It is desirable that these batch scripts work
   from underneath all of those shells.

 * Add prerequisites, with links to more on satisfying the prerequisites.

 * There needs to be a location (nfoWare, likely) where illustrated use 
   is provided, and the latest version can be obtained independent of the
   project that redistributes a VCbind.zip.

 * Create VCbind.zip for use in Adv10.

 * Create VCbind.bat in a way that is usable from sibling folders.  This must
   cope with the absence of a full path for the location of the source tree
   that contains a VCbind-using construction set.
   
 * There seems to be no reason to include the development source in the
   VCbind.zip itself.  
   
 * Because it is usable as a separate redistributable, VCbind.zip needs to
   include a LICENSE and NOTICE file of its own.
   
 * VCbind.zip needs to provide information on how to deploy VCbind.zip for
   anyone to incorporate it.  This might link to the maintained source, and
   it should also be complete enough for free-standing redistribution.
   
 * Where the modification of VCbind.zip and its scripts is described is not
   clear.  If there is a VCbind/ folder here, it should include whatever
   goes into the VCbind.zip.  
   
 * Companion material that should be redistributable at the level of 
   VCBind.zip needs packaging (VCBinder.zip?).  This should not put us in
   a meta-recursion problem.  One thing that must be added by the user is
   any .gitignore for VCBind/ or the equivalent, depending on how they
   want this to work properly and to keep the source code intact.
   
 * VCBind.zip needs to include maintenance instructions.

 0.0.2 2016-10-23-11:15 Placeholder for provisional VCBind development.
       Move from ShowDefs and setup for source separate from the tree
       that VCbind.zip extracts.
 0.01 2014-12-25-20:44 Use provisional VCbind.bat script for testing and
      establishment of a more-resilient version.
