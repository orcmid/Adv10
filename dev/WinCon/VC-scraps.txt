            This is not check in.  It is used for development.

                      SHOWDEFS IN VISUAL C/C++ COMPILES
                      =================================

    This folder provides demonstrations of ways to use the Microsoft
    Visual C/C++ compilers in command-line builds of code targeted to
    VC-supported platforms.  This allows employment of that compiler and
    other Microsoft tools for targeting portable source code to Windows
    without compelling use of the Visual Studio IDE and its solution-
    building model.

    Setting of options, pre-processor definitions, and use of appropriate
    libraries is required.  This is accomplished with easily configured
    and adapted scripts.

    The VCShowDefs.c file is compiled to demonstrate equivalent builds and
    their control, paralleling builds accomplished using Visual Studio
    in the neighboring folder, ShowDefs/VS2013/.

VISUAL C/C++ VERSIONS
    The easiest way to obtain the Visual C command-line compiler, cl.exe,
    is by installing one of the free versions of Visual Studio.  The scripts
    here work with VC in VS2012 through VS2015 Preview.  See the VS2013/
    folder for information on obtaining free Visual Studio versions.

    Windows 7 and later are required for operating these versions of Visual
    Studio.

BINDING THE VC COMPILER
    A common script is used to locate and set the environment path and other
    variables that are required in order to operate with the VC compiler,
    its libraries, include files, and related tools.

    The VCbind.zip file is extracted to provide the script that establishes
    a compiler setup.  VCbind.txt describes that package and its usage.

    The VCbind.run file here is used from other projects to check that
    VCbind.zip is here and that a VCbind\VCbind.bat file is present and is
    then used.

 EXAMPLE COMPILATIONS
    Each example is in its own subfolder, such as ShowDef\VC\Default.  The
    text file with the same name as the subfolder describes the procedure to
    follow.

MANIFEST

    VC.txt
        This description file on the construction and organization of
        the material.

    .gitignore
        Git file for excluding the VCbind/ folder from the ShowDefs source-
        code tree.

    VCbind.bat
        A batch script that can be used from any location to verify the
        presence of VCbind and Vcbind\VCbind.bat here, then performing it
        to establish the environment used by the different cases here,
        such as Default.

    VCbind.txt
        The manifest and procedures applicable to use of VCbind.zip

    VCbind.zip
        The script material for extraction in folder BCbind/ and used in
        support of the compilation examples.

    VCbind/
        subfolder created when VCbind.zip is extracted.  This working folder
        is not of the ShowDefs code tree.  Any customization of the material
        applies only locally.

    Default/
        Visual C compiler demonstration of the pre-processor definitions
        supplied when compiling a simple *.c file as the source code.

TODO

 * Verify the VC structure with VS2013 and any other current VS installs.

 * Verify the structure with cmd.exe, PowerShell, TC, and MSYS2 (POSIX)
   shells and possibly CYGWIN.  It is desirable that these batch scripts work
   from underneath all of those shells.

 * Add prerequisites, with links to more on satisfying the prerequisites.

 * We need some images and related documentation here where it is common to
   all of the cases in this folder.

 0.03 2014-12-26-10:06 Completion of some work items reflecting progress
      with the Default example.
 0.02 2014-12-25-20:35 Bring back VCbind.bat as a relay in the manner of
      VS2013\Default\DefaultProject.bat.
 0.01 2014-12-18-18:41 Adjust Manifest
      .gitignore is accounted for and the convenience file VCbind.bat is
      eliminated from the VC/ level.
 0.00 2014-12-13-15:12 Placeholcer for the C/C++ for VC Command-Line Compiles
      Initiate structure for command-line compilations analogous to the VS2013
      Projects.
