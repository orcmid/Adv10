            This is a file from which scraps may be useful in 
            annotating WinCon and the provisional VCBinder 
            development.
            
    This folder provides demonstrations of ways to use the Microsoft
    Visual C/C++ compilers in command-line builds of code targeted to
    VC-supported platforms.  This allows employment of that compiler and
    other Microsoft tools for targeting portable source code to Windows
    without compelling use of the Visual Studio IDE and its solution-
    building model.


VISUAL C/C++ VERSIONS
    The easiest way to obtain the Visual C command-line compiler, cl.exe,
    is by installing one of the free versions of Visual Studio.  The scripts
    here work with VC in VS2012 through VS2015 Preview.  See the VS2013/
    folder for information on obtaining free Visual Studio versions.

    Windows 7 and later are required for operating these versions of Visual
    Studio.

BINDING THE VC COMPILER
    A common script is used to locate and set the environment path and other
    variables that are required in order to operate with the VC compiler,
    its libraries, include files, and related tools.

    The VCbind.zip file is extracted to provide the script that establishes
    a compiler setup.  VCbind.txt describes that package and its usage.

    The VCbind.run file here is used from other projects to check that
    VCbind.zip is here and that a VCbind\VCbind.bat file is present and is
    then used.

THE VCBINDER EXTRACTS

    VCbind.bat
        A batch script that can be used from any location to verify the
        presence of VCbind and Vcbind\VCbind.bat here, then performing it
        to establish the environment used by command-line development
        cases.

    VCbind.txt
        The manifest and procedures applicable to use of VCbind.zip

    VCbind.zip
        The script material for extraction in folder BCbind/ and used in
        support of the compilation examples.

    VCbind/
        subfolder created when VCbind.zip is extracted.  This working folder
        is not under source-code version control.  Any customization of the
        material applies only locally.

TODO

 * Verify the VC structure with VS2013 and any other current VS installs.

 * Verify the structure with cmd.exe, PowerShell, TC, and MSYS2 (POSIX)
   shells and possibly CYGWIN.  It is desirable that these batch scripts work
   from underneath all of those shells.

 * Add prerequisites, with links to more on satisfying the prerequisites.

 * We need some images and related documentation here where it is common to
   all of the cases in this folder.
   
 * Blend these TODOs and the specimen material into the appropriate parts of
   VCbinder.
   
 * Move these scraps over to the VCbinder development where they are to be
   used.
