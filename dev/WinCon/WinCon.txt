                    ADV10 WINDOWS CONSOLE CONSTRUCTION SETS
                    =======================================

    This construction set employs Microsoft Windows tools to construct
    a command-line console version of Adv10.  This form of the software
    is the closest to the original Collosal Cave Adventure when it 
    ran as a terminal application.

TODO

 * Work up the Visual C++ console compilation case.
 
 * Add VCbind/ and VCbuild/ for doing it all using the command line.
 
 * Add VCrun for running the result of a VCbuild or VCproject.
 
 * Add VCproject/ for doing all of this with Visual Studio.
 
 * See if there is a slick way to use Visual Code to do all of this.
 
 * Evaluate whether the CLang front end is an useful alternative.
 
 * Add prerequisities for the Windows Console build.
 
 * Add something about more information on constructing and verifying
   a build, and simply using the result to play the game.
 
 * Add anything about developing/maintaining the WinCon set.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
 
 * Get to the first level of clean compilation for an executable null 
   implementation, and work a form of test-driven spiral development.
   This is going to be the model for similar conduct on other platforms.
