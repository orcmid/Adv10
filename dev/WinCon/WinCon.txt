                 ADV10 WINDOWS CONSOLE VERSION CONSTRUCTION SET
                 ==============================================

    Adv10 on Windows runs in the Windows Command Shell via command-line 
    operation.  This is the closest to the 1977 FORTRAN Collosal Cave 
    Adventure used over computer terminals years before advent of the 
    Personal Computer.  It is close to an early MS-DOS program with text-
    only operation.  The advantage, now, is the use of today's powerful
    PCs as an on-ramp for derivation of more interesting versions beyond.
    
    The WinCon construction set provides for the following activities.
    
      * confirming that the prerequisite tools are in place for using
        the source code.
        
      * compiling the Adv10 C Language source code to an executable form,
        Adv10.exe, known as a console application.
        
      * operating Adv10.exe and confirming its local operation. 
      
      * deployment of Adv10 including installation on other Windows computers
      
    Using this construction set to produce the Adv10 Windows Console version
    is also by using the Windows Command Shell and command-line operations. 
      
    The construction set provides a progressive tool chain.  Each step
    in the chain depends on its predecessors and each step confirms that
    its predecessors are in place and have functioned.   By working through
    the progression one step at a time, you can confirm operation of the
    construction set or determine what may be required to complete a given
    step.  
    
    You can also start at the end of the tool chain by running Adv10Run.bat.
    See what needs to be provided to go further and try again (rinse-repeat)
    until Adv10Run succeeds.
         
    Testing, trouble-shooting, code maintenance, and adaptation of the 
    software are more-elaborate activities.  Additional resources
    and expertise are required.  Consult the provided references.
     
    Early work on this construction set is as the laboratory prototype for
    the WinCon Construction Kit, <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161103.htm>, 
    with code at <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools>/devKits/WinDev/WinConKit
    
    
PREREQUISITES

    [TBD]
    
DEPENDENCIES

  * Visual C command-line compiler, cl.exe, and its libraries for building
    standard C/C++ on a Microsoft Windows PC.
    
    It is sufficient to obtain and install a free version of Microsoft Visual
    Studio or Microsoft Visual C.  For suggestions of versions that adv10 is
    tested with, see <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101b.htm>.
    
CONFIRMING DEPENDENCIES
    
BUILDING ADV10.EXE

    [TBD]

OPERATING AND DEPLOYING ADV10.EXE.

    [TBD]
    
WORKING ON THE ADV10 SOURCE CODE

    [TBD]
    
   
MANIFEST

    .gitignore
        Ignoring folders that are created only for construction activity
        and not intended as part of the distributed source codes.  This
        prevents local customizations of working material from infecting
        the shared public source-code tree on GitHub.

    WinCon.txt
        This description file on organization of the construction set
        and use of its materials.
        
    Adv10Run.bat
        Script for running a built Adv10.exe.  If Adv10.exe has not yet been
        built successfully, building will be attempted.
        
    Adv10Built.bat
        Script for ensuring that Adv10 has been built successfully and, if 
        not, attempting to build it.
        
    VCensure.bat
        script for confirming that the current session is set up for using
        the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and other command-line tools.
        VCensure will set up the VC++ command-line environment if it is not
        already established.      
        
    Adv10Build.zip
        Experimental build component to confirm compilation and the intended
        next link in this construct-set tool chain.  Extract to Adv10Build\       

    VCbind.zip
        package which provides the VC++ command-line setup script when 
        extracted to VCbind\ here.
        
    VCbind-0.2.0.txt
        manifest and instructions from VCbind.zip available for review
        before extracting VCbind.zip.  Useful for becoming more involved
        in details of the construction and command-line configuration
        options.

TODO
 
 * Include prerequisite on configuring a Windows PC for development work.
   The web materials should be part of Toolcraft.  Some of this is also
   relevant for power users and for confident use of third-party software.
   
 * Include prerequisites on using the Windows Command Shell.
 
 * Provide information, somewhere, on alternatives to the Windows Command
   Shell.  One can assume that those users are more knowledgable and
   provide a quick way for an user to calibrate their readiness.
 
 * Add VCbind/ and Adv10Build/ for doing it all using the command line.
 
 * Add Adv10Run.bat for running the result of a VCbuild (or VS/VC project?)
 
 * Add VSAdv10.zip for doing all of this with Visual Studio?
 
 * Consider VScode for using Visual Code if we can get the workspace to
   work the way we need.  It does not appear that Visual Code compiles will
   work well with the code in a different place than the VS Code workspace.
 
 * Evaluate whether the CLang front end is an useful alternative.
 
 * Add prerequisities for the Windows Console build.
 
 * Add something about more information on constructing and verifying
   a build, and simply using the result to play the game.
 
 * Add anything about developing/maintaining the WinCon set.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
      
 * It is not clear whether and how Micosoft Visual Studio Team Services
   online is helpful here, especially for WinCon builds.  However, figuring
   out Release Management and integration with Visual Studio Code are all
   interesting cases.  <https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/>.
