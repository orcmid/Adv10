                    ADV10 WINDOWS CONSOLE CONSTRUCTION SET
                    ======================================

    This construction set employs Microsoft Windows tools to construct
    a command-line console version of Adv10.  This form of the software
    is the closest to the original Collosal Cave Adventure when it 
    ran as a terminal application.

MANIFEST

    .gitignore
        Ignoring folders that are created only for construction activity
        and not intended as part of the maintained source tree.  This
        prevents local customizations of working material from infecting
        the shared public source-code tree.

    WinCon.txt
        This description file on organization of the construction set
        and use of its materials.
        
    VCbinder/
        Provisional location of code for development of the redistributable
        VCbind.zip and VCbinder.zip construction-set components.  These are
        independent components that are convenient to develop and verify
        in concert with the Adv10 WinCon use of them.

TODO
 
 * A makefile project to update VCbind.zip would also be cool.

 * Adapt the ShowDefs VC.txt 0.03 introduction for WinCon.
 
 * Scavenge other parts of VCbind from ShowDefs too.

 * Work up the Visual C++ console compilation case.
 
 * Add VCbind/ and VCbuild/ for doing it all using the command line.
 
 * Add VCrun for running the result of a VCbuild or VCproject.
 
 * Add VCproject/ for doing all of this with Visual Studio.
 
 * See if there is a slick way to use Visual Code to do all of this.
 
 * Evaluate whether the CLang front end is an useful alternative.
 
 * Add prerequisities for the Windows Console build.
 
 * Add something about more information on constructing and verifying
   a build, and simply using the result to play the game.
 
 * Add anything about developing/maintaining the WinCon set.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
 
 * Get to the first level of clean compilation for an executable null 
   implementation, and work a form of test-driven spiral development.
   This is going to be the model for similar conduct on other platforms.
