                 ADV10 WINDOWS CONSOLE VERSION CONSTRUCTION SET
                 ==============================================

    Adv10 on Windows runs in the Windows Command Shell via command-line 
    operation.  This form of operation is the closest to the 1977 FORTRAN
    Collosal Cave Adventure introduced as a computer terminal application
    years before arrival of the Personal Computer.
    
    Using this construction set to produce the Adv10 Windows Console version
    from the C Language source is also by using the Windows Command Shell
    and command-line operations.   
    
    The WinCon construction set provides for the following activities.
    
      * confirming that the prerequisite tools are in place for using
        the source code.
        
      * compiling the Adv10 C Language source code to an executable form,
        Adv10.exe, known as a console application.
        
      * operating Adv10.exe and confirming its local operation. 
      
      * deployment of Adv10 including installation on other Windows computers
      
    The construction set consists of a progressive tool chain.  Each step
    in the chain depends on its predecessors and each step confirms that
    its predecessors are in place and have functioned.   By working through
    the progression one step at a time, you can confirm operation of the
    construction set and determine what may be required to complete the
    step. 
      
    Details are sufficient for downloading a general release of the Adv10
    project code, compiling that version of Adv10.exe, and confirming
    successful operation of the features of that release: Play the available
    game.  
    
    Testing, trouble-shooting, code maintenance, and adaptation of the 
    software are more elaborate activities for which additional resources
    and expertise are required.  Consult the provided references.
     
    Early work on this construction set is as the laboratory prototype for
    the WinCon Construction Kit <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161103.htm>

PREREQUISITES

    [TBD]
    
DEPENDENCIES

  * Visual C command-line compiler, cl.exe, and its libraries for building
    standard C/C++ on a Microsoft Windows PC.
    
    It is sufficient to obtain and install a free version of Microsoft Visual
    Studio or Microsoft Visual C.  
    
CONFIRMING DEPENDENCIES
    
BUILDING ADV10.EXE

    [TBD]

OPERATING AND DEPLOYING ADV10.EXE.

    [TBD]
    
WORKING ON THE ADV10 SOURCE CODE

    [TBD]
    
   
MANIFEST

    .gitignore
        Ignoring folders that are created only for construction activity
        and not intended as part of the distributed source codes.  This
        prevents local customizations of working material from infecting
        the shared public source-code tree on GitHub.

    WinCon.txt
        This description file on organization of the construction set
        and use of its materials.
        
    Adv10Build.zip
        Experimental build component to confirm compilation and the intended
        next link in this construct-set tool chain.
        
    VCensure.bat
        script for confirming that the current session is set up for using
        the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and other command-line tools.
        VCensure will provide an initial VCbind if one is needed.
        
    VCbind-0.2.0.txt
        manifest and instructions from VCbind.zip available for review
        before extracting VCbind.zip.
        
    VCbind.zip
        package which provides the working VC binding script when extracted
        to VCbind/ here.

TODO

 * Obtain a VCenable from DocInterop or elsewhere and customize for use
   here and then incorporating in VCbinder 0.1.1 at nfoTools.
 
 * Work up the Visual C++ console compilation case.
 
 * Include prerequisite on configuring a Windows PC for development work.
   The web materials should be part of Toolcraft.  Some of this is also
   relevant for power users and for confident use of third-party software.
   
 * Include prerequisites on using the Windows Command Shell.
 
 * Provide information, somewhere, on alternatives to the Windows Command
   Shell.  One can assume that the users are more knowledgable or at least
   provide a quick way for an user to collaborate themselves for that case.
 
 * Add VCbind/ and Adv10Build/ for doing it all using the command line.
 
 * Add Adv10Run/ for running the result of a VCbuild (or VS/VC project?)
 
 * Add VSproject/ for doing all of this with Visual Studio.
 
 * Consider VScode for using Visual Code if we can get the workspace to
   work the way we need.  It does not appear that Visual Code compiles will
   work well with the code in a different place than where the build happens.
   There is also a problem with the code being in a different location than
   the workspace.  
 
 * Evaluate whether the CLang front end is an useful alternative.
 
 * Add prerequisities for the Windows Console build.
 
 * Add something about more information on constructing and verifying
   a build, and simply using the result to play the game.
 
 * Add anything about developing/maintaining the WinCon set.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
      
 * It is not clear whether and how Micosoft Visual Studio Team Services
   online is helpful here, especially for WinCon builds.  However, figuring
   out Release Management and integration with Visual Studio Code are all
   interesting cases.  <https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/>.
