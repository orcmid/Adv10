                      ADV10 DEVELOPER CONSTRUCTION SETS
                      =================================

    Developer construction sets are platform-specific structures for 
    compiling and exercising the Adv10 software.  
    
    In this approach, the code is always compilable and executable as
    we work through the 0.*.* semantic versions.  There should always be
    tests for confirmation of the results as well.  When there are version
    releases, the construction set will build the developer version of that 
    release.
    
    For Adv10, the WinConconstruction set is designed to provide an entry-
    leve exercise for novices who wish to construct the Adv10 program for 
    themselves as introduction to coding for fun, computer programming for 
    everyone (CP4E), and a little software-engineering for everyone (SE4E)
    as well. 
    
    The main thrust for the Adv10 project is demonstration development on 
    and for the Microsoft Windows platform. Other platforms and construction 
    will be entertained later in the project.  
    
    Developer versions of Adv10 lack detailed branding for the installed
    program.  Essential parameters for branding and delivery via app stores
    and other means are omitted.  Each provider of authenticated and 
    verificable versions must provide their own secure authentication along 
    with appropriate branding.  The purpose of this separation is to impede 
    counterfeiting and to reveal imposter versions of the software targeting
    innocent end-users. 
    
    In all other respects, development of Adv10 provides code in the open 
    made available under an open-source license.
    
    
MANIFEST

    dev.txt
        This description file on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.
        
    WinCon/
        Construction set for Windows Console version of Adv10.  Construction
        employs freely-available Microsoft development tools for construction
        on the Microsoft Windows PC platform.
        
    VCbinder/ (depracated)
        originally, code for development of the redistributable VCbinder.zip
        construction-set snippet.  These are now tombstones pending switch
        of Adv10 to VCbinder and WinConKit dependencies maintained at the
        nfoTools project.

TODO

 * Work up the Visual C++ console compilation case, WinCon
 
 * Add something about where devKits for constructions sets are found.
 
 * Add something about developing/maintaining construction sets.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
 
 * Get to the first level of clean compilation for an executable null 
   implementation, and work a form of test-driven spiral development.

 0.0.4 2016-12-11-09:31 VCbinder now deprecated and aspects of WinCon
       clarified.  TODO scrubbing.
 0.0.3 2016-10-26-11:25 Move the provisional VCbinder/ development to
       this level, for experimental use within WinCon/
 0.0.2 2016-10-24-08:02 Light editing, motivation for Windows emphasis.
 0.0.1 2016-10-22-11:12 Introduce the WinCon/ construction set.
       The limitation to unbranded dev builds is also emphasized.
 0.0.0 2016-10-15-13:12 Initial Placeholder as part of folder setup.
