                      ADV10 DEVELOPER CONSTRUCTION SETS
                      =================================

    Developer construction sets are platform-specific structures for 
    compiling and exercising the Adv10 software.  
    
    In this approach, the code is always compilable and executable as
    we work through the 0.*.* semantic versions.  There should always be
    tests as well.  When there are version releases, the construction set
    will build the developer version of that release.
    
    It is intended that developer versions do not provide branding of any
    kind.  That also means deployment does not include the essential steps
    for branding and delivery via app stores and other means for authenti-
    cated end-user versions.  
    
    The purpose of this division is to avoid counterfeiting and creation of
    imposter versions of software intended for casual users.  Each provider
    of authenticated and verificable deployments must provide their own
    secure authentication along with any appropriate branding.

        employs freely-available Microsoft development tools for construction
        on the Microsoft Windows PC platform.

TODO

 * Work up the Visual C++ console compilation case, WinCon
 
 * Add something about finding how to build particular construction sets.
   It can be appropriate pointers.
 
 * Add something about developing/maintaining construction sets.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
 
 * Get to the first level of clean compilation for an executable null 
   implementation, and work a form of test-driven spiral development.
