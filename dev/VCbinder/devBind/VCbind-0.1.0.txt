 1. OVERVIEW

    VCbind.zip delivers a Windows batch script for setting up a command-
    line environment.  The provided environment enables compiling with the
    Microsoft Visual C/C++ command-line compiler, cl.exe, aud using related
    Microsoft developer tools.
    
    VCbind.zip is intended as a component of larger construction sets. 
    Consult construction-set instructions for amendments on for VCbind.zip 
    for extraction and usage of the contents.  
    
    Ordinarily, construction sets using VCbind version 0.1.0 have a copy 
    of this file, VCbind-0.1.0.txt, alongside the VCbind.zip file.  Use
    the version included in VCbind.zip if it is different.
    
    VCbind.zip is to be extracted at the location where it appears in a
    construction set.  The result is a companion folder with the following
    structure:
    
               construction-set-location\
                  ...
                  VCbind.zip    *location in the construction set
                  VCbind\       *created by extraction
                     ...
                     Vcbind-0.1.0.txt
                     VCbind.bat
                  ...
                  
    The VCbind\ folder is not part of the construction-set source-code.  
    Create it by extraction of VCbind.zip whenever the construction set is 
    used.  If desired, customize the extracted VCbind\ content, leaving the
    construction-set code intact.  Restore VCbind\ to its original form by 
    deleting th extracted folder and re-extracting from VCbind.zip.
