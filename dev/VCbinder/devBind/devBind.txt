                             VCBIND.ZIP CONSTRUCTION
                             =======================

    Folder devBind/ provides the files and the procedure for constructing
    a VCbind.zip component.  VCbind.zip can be deployed and used directly.
    It is also deployable via VCbinder.zip; consult devBinder/ for one
    approach to deployment of VCbind.zip.

        version control

        preview as well as instructions following extraction
         
    VCbind.bat
        script included in VCbind.zip that provides the binding operation

TODO

 * Provide the construction procedure.
 
 * Add the VCbind.txt that will be the manifest and instructions included
   in VCbind.zip.
   
 * Develop the VCbind.bat file that will be the one operated within the
   folder extracted from VCbind.zip
   
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2015 VC (Version 14.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2013 VC (Version 12.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2012 VC (Version 11.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2010 VC (Version 10.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2008 VC (Version 9.0)
 
 * Is it meaningful to go as far back as VS2005 (Version 8.0)?
 
 * Determine the oldest Visual Studio that we want to support in general.
   Applications of VCbind might determine their own limitations on the
   variety.
   
 * Setup to always find and use vcvarsall and do not use any version of
   Visual Studio that does not have that.
   
 * Determine the default compile and also determine the parameters for the
   calls on the different detected Visual Studio, Visual C++ environment
   variations.
   
 * Need a way to VCunbind as a way to clean up and/or remove an existing
   binding in order to introduce a new one.  
   
 * Verify that the command shell VCbind is called in has local variables
   and unbinding is locally only.  This also means that the VCbind endures
   only as long as the single console session.  Confirm this.
   
 * It does not seem possible to double-expand.  E.g., it is possible to
   SET VSchoice=VS%VCver%COMNTOOLS but VSchoice will have the environment
   variable name, not its value.  We can determine
   [NOT] DEFINED VS%VCver%COMNTOOLS but there is no way to obtain its value
   that way.   
   
 * Check the different vcvarsall.bat files for VC++ to ensure consistencies.
 
 * Put references on creating and using batch scripts somewhere.  There is
   now (Windows 10) extensive help files built in, along with more on MSDN.
   There is also the Command Line Admionistrator's Pocket Handbook.
