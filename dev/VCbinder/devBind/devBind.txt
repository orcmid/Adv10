                             VCBIND.ZIP CONSTRUCTION
                             =======================
                             
    The files and the VCbind.zip here are in-progress development versions. 
    For the latest considered-stable version for general use, check the
    VCbinder/ folder, above.

    Folder devBind/ provides the files for under-development maintenance,
    testing, and delivery of a VCbind.zip drop-in for use in software
    source-code construction sets.      VCbinder and its development in
    devBinder/ illustrates one way to accomplish that in the routine
    development of construction sets.
    
    The details of VCbind.zip and its usage are in the file VCbind.txt.
    That file is provided in VCbind.zip.  It is also recommended that
    VCbind.txt be placed as a companion of VCbind.zip so that users can
    determine how to proceed before extracting the VCbind.zip content.
    
PREREQUISITE CAPABILITIES FOR VCBIND DEVELOPMENT WORK

  * Performing console (cmd.exe) command-line sessions on Microsoft Windows.
  
  * Understanding and using the command-line environment of Windows and how
    the Visual C++ components are found and operated on Windows.
    
  * Experience with the built-in Compressed (zipped) Folder support of
    Microsoft Windows.
    
  * Ability to demonstrate the testing and confirmation of VCbind.bat
    operation, including all of the exception-handling cases.
    
  * Using the Microsoft cl.exe command-line compiler in demonstrating 
    demonstration of successful VCbind accomplishment.
    
  
DEVBIND MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT

  1. Have this source code folder in a PC location where you can edit all 
     of its content.  If the folder is not named devBind\, adjust what 
     follows below accordingly.  It is recommended that you have a clone
     or fork of the origin repository in order to have source-code control
     of your changes, whether or not for contribution back to the origin
     project.
     
  2. In the devBind\ folder, follow the VCbind.txt instructions and
     extract VCbind.zip to the subfolder, VCbind\ (i.e., Windows 
     folder location devBind\VCbind\).
     
  3. Perform editing and testing in the VCbind\ subfolder.  
  
  4. When done, or at a checkpoint, move your changes and additions from
     the devBind\VCbind\ folder back to the devBind folder.  Delete the
     VCbind folder so there is no confusion about what is the current work.
     If there is nothing you want to change, simply delete the VCbind\ 
     folder.
     
  5. Synchronize VCbind.zip with your work.  To keep the changes copied
     from VCbind\ at step 4,
  
     5.1 Delete the VCbind.zip file.
     
     5.2 In the Windows File Explorer, creat a New Compress (zipped) Folder
         in devBind\.  Name it VCbind.zip.
         
     5.3 Drag the VCbind.zip-intened  devBind\ files into the new, empty
         VCbind.zip: LICENSE.txt, NOTICE.txt, VCbind.bat, and VCbind.txt. 
         If there are additional files included in VCbind.zip, copy those
         into the VCbind.zip as well.
         
  6. Adjust this devBind.txt to reflect any change to the manifest and 
     anything else that needs to be changed to have current documentation.
     
  7. Check-in the modified/new materials under the source-code management
     you are using.  Depending on the state of completion and project
     requirements for thorough testing, contribute back to any project
     this work is on behalf of.

TODO

 * Provide links for the prerequisites.
 
 * Develop the VCbind.bat file that will be the one operated within the
   folder extracted from VCbind.zip
   
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2015 VC (Version 14.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2013 VC (Version 12.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2012 VC (Version 11.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2010 VC (Version 10.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2008 VC (Version 9.0)
 
 * Is it meaningful to go as far back as VS2005 (Version 8.0)?
 
 * Incorporte VCbind detection for the VC Compiler Tools distributions.  This
   works the same as Version 14.0.  It should be transparent.
 
 * Determine the oldest Visual Studio that we want to support in general.
   Applications of VCbind might determine their own limitations on the
   variety.
   
 * Setup to always find and use vcvarsall and do not use any version of
   Visual Studio that does not have that.
   
 * Determine the default compile and also determine the parameters for the
   calls on the different detected Visual Studio, Visual C++ environment
   variations.
   
 * Need a way to VCunbind as a way to clean up and/or remove an existing
   binding in order to introduce a new one.  There is a form of this in
   the vcvarsall procedure for Version 15.0, but nothing earlier.  There
   still might be an approach in that.
   
 * Verify that the command shell VCbind is called in has local variables
   and unbinding is locally only.  This also means that the VCbind endures
   only as long as the single console session.  Confirm this.
   
 * It does not seem possible to double-expand.  E.g., it is possible to
   SET VSchoice=VS%VCver%COMNTOOLS but VSchoice will have the environment
   variable name, not its value.  We can determine
   [NOT] DEFINED VS%VCver%COMNTOOLS but there is no way to obtain its value
   that way.   
   
 * The Microsoft Visual Studio "15" Preview 5 setup is very different than
   for any previous versions.  It is a considerable hack and might not be
   worth supporting.  It can be supported but needs to be flagged as a
   temporary hack pending availability of an RTM Community version.
 
 * Put references on creating and using batch scripts somewhere.  There is
   now (Windows 10) extensive help files built in, along with more on MSDN.
   There is also the Command Line Admionistrator's Pocket Handbook.
   
 * Verify the VCbind structure with VS2015 and any other current VS installs.

 * Verify the structure with cmd.exe, PowerShell, TC, and MSYS2 (POSIX)
   shells and possibly CYGWIN.  It is desirable that these batch scripts work
   from underneath all of those shells.

 * Find references for the prerequisite information.  These will probably be
   in nfoWare ToolCraft or some devtools area.

 * We need a tutorial/HowTo location on nfoWare.com with images and related 
   documentation for the cases that apply here.
   
 * We need to get this far enough to apply in test builds and runs of the
   Adv10 WinCon case.  Don't worry so much about documentation completeness
   until we have the scripts in use.  It is all provisional while Adv10 is
   in 0.0.* development.
   
 * Create a VCbind.zip that is tied to devBind, VCbinder, and such.

 * VCbind.bat can be referenced from anywhere.  It is not necessary to
   change the current working directory in order to employ VCbind.bat.
   Having shortcuts to help with this might be something that should
   be encouraged but not handled in detail here.  That seems like another
   HOWTO to address on nfoWare.
   
 * Do we want VCbind.zip to be signed?  That's not a particularly bad
   idea. Not clear what the best way to accomplish it is that ensures
   use of a proper public key though.
   
 * Allude to VCbinder in some fashion.  Maybe in a section on 
   REDISTRIBUTION in VCbind.txt
   
 * Provide a checklist of the testing cases that apply to VCbind.bat.
 
 * Verify that %VisualStudioVersion% is set by all vcvarsall.bat scripts,
   as well as %VCINSTALLDIR%.  See how to make use of that when there has
   evidently been a run of vcvarsall.bat already.
   
 * Don't use vsvars32.bat at all?  It might not even be a good test for
   presence of an installed version.
   
 * Figure out a difference of mostly-silent versus annotated terminal
   presence.
