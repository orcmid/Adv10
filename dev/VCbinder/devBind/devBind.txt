                             VCBIND.ZIP CONSTRUCTION
                             =======================

    Folder devBind/ provides the files and the procedure for constructing
    a VCbind.zip component.  VCbind.zip can be deployed and used directly.
    It is also deployable via VCbinder.zip; consult devBinder/ for one
    approach to deployment of VCbind.zip.
    
    The details of VCbind.zip and its usage are in the file VCbind.txt.
    That file is provided within VCbind.zip.  It is also recommended that
    the file be placed as a companion of VCbind.zip so that users can
    determine how to proceed before extracting the VCbind.zip content.

TODO

 * Provide the construction procedure.
 
 * Develop the VCbind.bat file that will be the one operated within the
   folder extracted from VCbind.zip
   
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2015 VC (Version 14.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2013 VC (Version 12.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2012 VC (Version 11.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2010 VC (Version 10.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2008 VC (Version 9.0)
 
 * Is it meaningful to go as far back as VS2005 (Version 8.0)?
 
 * Incorporte Bind detection for the VC Compiler Tools distributions.  This
   works the same as Version 14.0.  It should be transparent.
 
 * Determine the oldest Visual Studio that we want to support in general.
   Applications of VCbind might determine their own limitations on the
   variety.
   
 * Setup to always find and use vcvarsall and do not use any version of
   Visual Studio that does not have that.
   
 * Determine the default compile and also determine the parameters for the
   calls on the different detected Visual Studio, Visual C++ environment
   variations.
   
 * Need a way to VCunbind as a way to clean up and/or remove an existing
   binding in order to introduce a new one.  There is a form of this in
   the vcvarsall procedure for Version 15.0, but nothing earlier.  There
   still might be an approach in that.
   
 * Verify that the command shell VCbind is called in has local variables
   and unbinding is locally only.  This also means that the VCbind endures
   only as long as the single console session.  Confirm this.
   
 * It does not seem possible to double-expand.  E.g., it is possible to
   SET VSchoice=VS%VCver%COMNTOOLS but VSchoice will have the environment
   variable name, not its value.  We can determine
   [NOT] DEFINED VS%VCver%COMNTOOLS but there is no way to obtain its value
   that way.   
   
 * The Microsoft Visual Studio "15" Preview 5 setup is very different than
   for any previous versions.  It is a considerable hack and might not be
   worth supporting.  It can be supported but needs to be flagged as an
   awful hack.
 
 * Put references on creating and using batch scripts somewhere.  There is
   now (Windows 10) extensive help files built in, along with more on MSDN.
   There is also the Command Line Admionistrator's Pocket Handbook.
   
 * Verify the VCbind structure with VS2015 and any other current VS installs.

 * Verify the structure with cmd.exe, PowerShell, TC, and MSYS2 (POSIX)
   shells and possibly CYGWIN.  It is desirable that these batch scripts work
   from underneath all of those shells.

 * Add prerequisites, with links to more on satisfying the prerequisites.

 * We need a tutorial/HowTo location on nfoWare.com with images and related 
   documentation for the cases that apply here.
   
 * We need to get this far enough to apply in test builds and runs of the
   Adv10 WinCon case.  Don't worry so much about documentation completeness
   until we have the scripts in use.  It is all provisional while Adv10 is
   in 0.0.* development.
   
* We need some images and related documentation here where it is common to
   all of the cases in this folder.  This should be at the nfoWare location.

 * Create VCbind.zip

 * Create VCbind.bat in a way that is usable from sibling folders.  This must
   cope with the absence of a full path for the location of ShowDefs as a
   working clone of the GitHub respository.
   
 * Do we want VCbind.zip to be signed?  That's not a particularly bad
   idea. Not clear what the best way to accomplish it is that ensures
   use of a proper public key though.
   
 * Allude to VCbinder in some fashion.  Maybe in a section on 
   REDISTRIBUTION in VCbind.txt
