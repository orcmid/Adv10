                   TOMBSTONE: OBSOLETE PROVISIONAL DEVELOPMENT
                   *******************************************
                      
    Further development of devBind/ has been moved to the nfoTools project.
    The work is spun out from Adv10 to provide a shared, general utility
    for application in other projects.
            
    Work on this subtree of Adv10 is removed.  For further development,
    see <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools>/devKits/WinDev/VCbinder/devBind/
    and also check <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101.htm> for developing
    documentation and releases.
    
    RETENTION PRIOR TO FURTHER REMOVAL
    
    The release of VCbind 0.1.0 was made under the VCbinder/devBind/
    source tree.  The release artifacts are now retained in the 
    adjacent VCbinder/devBinder/ folder.  The subsequent changes in devBind/
    are preserved and under further development at the nfoTools location.
                             

MANIFEST

    only to provide a tombstone and directions to where there is further work

    In addition to these TODO items, the web-facing material on

    at <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101a.htm>.
