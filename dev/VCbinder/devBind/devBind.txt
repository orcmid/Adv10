TODO

 * Provide the construction procedure.
 
 * Add the VCbind.txt that will be the manifest and instructions included
   in VCbind.zip.
   
 * Develop the VCbind.bat file that will be the one operated within the
   folder extracted from VCbind.zip
   
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2015 VC (Version 14.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2013 VC (Version 12.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2012 VC (Version 11.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2010 VC (Version 10.0)
 
 * Incorporate Bind detection for VS2008 VC (Version 9.0)
 
 * Determine the oldest Visual Studio that we want to support in general.
   Applications of VCbind might determine their own limitations on the
   variety.
   
 * Distinguish between vcvarsall.bat and vcvars.bat and determine which to
   use.  
   
 * Determine the default compile and also determine the parameters for the
   calls on the different detected Visual Studio, Visual C++ environment
   variations.
   
 * Need a way to VCunbind as a way to clean up and/or remove an existing
   binding in order to introduce a new one.  
   
 * Verify that the command shell VCbind is called in has local variables
   and unbinding is locally only.  This also means that the VCbind endures
   only as long as the single console session.  Confirm this.
   
 * Confirm batch-script variables used in environment setting operations
   operations, such as IF DEFINED VS%VCbound%COMNTOOLS and 
   SET VCcommon=VS%VCbound%COMNTOOLS as a way of finding and selecting
   versions of Visual Studio to be detected and used for the common
   command-line tools.
   
 * Check the different vcvarsall.bat files for VC++ to ensure consistencies.
 
 * Put references on creating and using batch scripts somewhere.  There is
   now (Windows 10) extensive help files built in, along with more on MSDN.
