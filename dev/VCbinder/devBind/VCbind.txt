              BINDINGS FOR VISUAL C/C++ COMMAND-LINE COMPILATION
              ==================================================

    VCbind.zip contains a Windows batch script for binding to the developer
    environment used for compiling with the Microsoft Visual C/C++ command- 
    line compiler, cl.exe, aud using related Microsoft developer tools.
    
    This **x.y.z** distribution of VCbind.zip is available on the web at
    <http://nfoWare.com/dev/**TBD**>.  Consult that page for the latest
    status, links to useful related material, and the most-recent version.
    If there is any concern for the authenticity or correctness of a
    VCbind.zip, obtain a full replacement from that location.

    VCbind.zip is to be extracted at the location where it appears in a
    construction set.  The result is a companion folder with the following
    structure:
    
               construction-set-location\
                  ...
                  VCbind.zip    *location in the construction set
                  VCbind\       *created by extraction
                     Vcbind.txt
                     VCbind.bat
                  ...
                  
    The VCbind\ folder is not part of the source-code.  It only needs to
    be created when the given construction set is to be used.  VCbind\ is a
    working folder that can be customized, if necessary, without touching the
    construction set code.  Restoration of the VCbind\ to its original
    form is by re-extracting it from VCbind.zip.  When the construction set
    is no longer needed, the VCbind\ folder can be deleted, leaving the
    construction set otherwise intact and reusable in the future.
