          CREATE VCBINDER FOR VISUAL C/C++ COMMAND-LINE DEVELOPMENT
          =========================================================
          
                      OBSOLETE PROVISIONAL DEVELOPMENT
                      ********************************
                      
    Further development of VCbinder has been moved to the nfoTools project.
    The work is spun out from Adv10 to provide a shared, general utility
    for application in other projects.
            
    Work on this subtree of Adv10 is now frozen.  For further development,
    see <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools>/devKits/WinDev/VCbinder/ and
    also check <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161102.htm> for developing
    documentation and releases.
    
    RETENTION PRIOR TO FURTHER REMOVAL
    
    The release of VCbind 0.1.0 was made under this Adv10 VCbinder source
    tree.  The VCbind-0.1.0 branch and VCbind-0.1.0-src tag will be preserved.
    
    After the first release from nfoTools (likely with a VCbind 0.1.1), this
    source-tree will be frozen on a final branch, then tombstoned and other-
    wise removed from the origin master.

TODO

 * Switch devBinder/ to obsolete.
 
 * Identify pending obsolescence of devBind, with removal once there is
   further release from nfoTools.
   
 * On the availability of a VCbind from nfoTools, adjust the material at
   nfoWare d161101c and d161101c-dist to preserve provanance and history
   while recommending use of the nfoWare distribution at d161101d.
     
 * After the Adv10 WinCon construction no longer employs components of
   this Adv10 VCbinder source tree, replace this source tree with tombstones
   and freeze it on a final VCbind branch.  The tombstones will locate the
   nfoTools continuation of the effort and the artifacts will be removed 
   from master.
