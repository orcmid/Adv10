                            VCBINDER SOURCE CODE
                            ====================
                            
                      OBSOLETE PROVISIONAL DEVELOPMENT
                      ********************************
                      
    Further development of devBinder/ has been moved to the nfoTools project.
    The work is spun out from Adv10 to provide a shared, general utility
    for application in other projects.
            
    Work on this subtree of Adv10 is now frozen.  For further development,
    see <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools>/devKits/WinDev/VCbinder/devBinder/
    and also check <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161102.htm> for developing
    documentation and releases.
    
    RETENTION PRIOR TO FURTHER REMOVAL
    
    The release of VCbind 0.1.0 was made under the current VCbinder/devBind/
    source tree.  The VCbind-0.1.0 branch and VCbind-0.1.0-src tag will be 
    preserved.  However, the only Adv10 retention of the released code is here.
    The adjacent devBind/ tree was already staged fore VCbind-0.1.0-next and
    that work is removed to the nfoTools counterpart.

TODO

 * When Adv10/dev/WinCon no longer relies on VCbind 0.1.0, the artifacts
   can be removed here and the tombstone completed.
