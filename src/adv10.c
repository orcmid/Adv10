 *
 *    Copyright Â© 1998 by Don Woods and Don Knuth; all rights reserved.
 *    Adapted with permission.
 *
 *    Derived by Dennis E. Hamilton from the 2010-01-26 version of Don
 *    Knuth's Literate Programming source code file, advent.w.gz, available
 *    at <http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html#advent>.
 *    This version incorporates all applicable errata published through
 *    November 2013 for Knuth's "Selected Papers on Fun and Games,"
 *    <http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fg.html>, identified as
 *    [fg] below.
 *
 *    WARNING AND APOLOGY: This code has been stripped away from the
 *    Literate Programming version.  If you want to understand the
 *    structure of this program and its behavior, I urge consultation
 *    of the literate (woven) version in a print ("final-form") version.
 *
 *    Whether or not a good idea, the purpose of this raw C version is to 
 *    have a form, with embedded narration, that is closer to the style of
 *    contemporary C/C++ Language open-source development practice.  The
 *    idea is to use that as a spring-board toward modularization and
 *    mutation into a variety of modern application flavors, including
 *    web, desktop GUI and mobile/tablet applications.  Internationalization,
 *    accessibility, tracing, and preservation of game state will be
 *    interesting challenges.
 *
 *    The version having code the closest to adv10.c is in the third printing
 *    of [fg].  For other sources as well as variations on the original,
 *    consult <http://nfoWare.com/giocchi/cavern/adv>.
 *
 *    To provide some correspondence with the literate version for those who
 *    start by examining this code, the section numberss of [fg] Chapter 27
 *    are used to identify the place where a given code fragment appears
 *    in the literate form.

/*   INTRODUCTION [fg:27.1]
     ======================
     This program presents the original 350-point Collosal Cave Adventure,
     as devised by Will Crowther and extended by Don Woods in 1977.  The
     FORTRAN version was converted to C Language and recast as a Literate
     Program (using CWEB) by Don Knuth and made available online in 1998.
       TODO:
         * Say more about organization and connection to the WEB version.
         * Explain the identification of sections and cross-references.
         * Include abbreviated connection with [fg:27.1] text.
     */

/*   THE PROGRAM [fg:27.2]
     =====================
     This program compiles to a single executable, adv10 (adv10.exe on
     Microsoft Windows).  When it is placed in a location where it can
     be operated by console command, just enter the name, 'adv10'.
        TO DO: Explain where instructions for compiling the program
               are found.
        TO DO: Explain where instructions for deployment and for
               operation of the program can also be found.
