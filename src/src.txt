                          ADV10 COMMON SOURCE CODE
                          ========================

    This is the common source for Adv10.  These files are used across
    multiple compile and test cases.

MANIFEST

    src.txt
        This description file on the construction and organization of
        the material.

    adv10.c
        The main source-code file for Adv10, initially a single C Language
        program derived by manually tangling advent.w with annotations.
        
    advent.w-to-adv10.c.txt
        This is a version of advent.w that is progressively scavenged to
        make expanded versions of adv10.c until there is a full working,
        compilable Clean C version.  As scavenging occurs, this file
        shrinks accordingly.

TODO

 * Provide more history and tie into the nfoWare materials.
 
 * Move material that does not have to be in adv10.c here instead of
   in-line in the adv10.c source.  Include general TDDO materials and
   other narratives.  There will still be  considerable narrative in the source code.
   
 * Annotate advent.w-to-adv10.c.txt to show the actual section titles in
   "Selected Papers on Fun & Games" Chapter 27, Adventure.
   
 * Annotate advent.w-to-adv10.c.txt to show the headings used in adv10.c
   when the corresponding content is transposed there from advent.w.
   
 * Change refeerences to portions of "Selected Papers on Fun & Games" to be
   [fd27.n].  Since we need a way to cross-reference back to the code, we
   need something that is easily searcheable and/or found by navigation.  
   Figure something out.
