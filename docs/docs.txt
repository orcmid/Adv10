TODO

  * Introduce Construction Structure and Construction Zone for hybridForm
    GitHub Pages production.

  * Explain how this folder is used to generate the GitHub pages, possibly
    with additional folders that are about the scaffolding and construction
    materials.  This should be under construction materials.  It shouuld be
    thin enough to be linked to docEng rather than duplicate what should be
    there for general application.

  * The challenge is to cover the authoring system, including template fuss,
    along with creation of the published pages.

  * Use Hugo to produce the initial site?  Learn how to work the open-source
    control of the authoring materials, the template and other customization,
    and of the published materials.  This should be similar to a site-server
    creation process except the authoring system is by a forked process.

  * Dig up the nfoCentrale materials that provide a clue to how I did this
    with Hexo and see if I can accomplish something similar with Hugo.  Hugo
    is an attempted  choice because of its simplicity, wide acceptance, and
    the prospect of use on the Miser Project with MathJax for LaTex formulas.

  * Provide detailed connection to the docEng pattern documentation whenever.

  * Migrate all dependencies on nfoWare.com content to dependencies here that
    make sense.  This might need to tie into release cases, although we are
    talking about finer-grained releases than any kind of nfoTools "release."
    There needs to be a software engineering patterm for this too?  The use of
    branches is being considered for this.

  * Add LICENSE and NOTICES, also place copyright symbol, etc. Add an
    explanation sort of like the Creative Commons simple deed.  Maybe in
    NOTICES.

  * Have Construction and About folder and appropriate links.  These should
    help with the authoring of subfolders.

  * Attribution on the published pages too?

  * Maybe source should be Hugo?  We have a sub-project problem here.  Check
    on nfoCentrale and Hexo use first.

  * Or Use Hybrid Forms, since they work using HTML segments in markdown,
    and I can use FrontPage in the construction structure if not for other
    parts.
