![Welcome to Adventure splash image](images/Adv10-0.0.0-splash.png)

> The ur-game for computers--Adventure--was originally written by Will
Crowther in 1975 or 1976 and significantly extended by Don Woods in 1977.
I have taken Wood's original FORTRAN program for Adventure Version 1.0 and
recast it in th CWEB idiom so that those pioneering ideas will be accessible
to a broader audience.
>> Donald E. Knuth [Knuth2011: p.235]

## Open-Source Adaptation

Copyright Â© 1998 by Don Woods and Don Knuth; all rights reserved.
Adapted with permission.

 Adv10 is derived from the 2010-01-26 version of Don Knuth's Literate
 Programming source code file, `advent.w.gz`, available at
 \[[Knuth's "advent"](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html#advent)\].

This version incorporates all applicable errate published through November
2013 in Knuth's "Selected Papers on Fun and Games
\[[fg](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fg.html)\].

## The Orcmid on GitHub Project

Adv10 releases are a personal homage to this amazing and inspiring game.

The Adv10 project produces a Clean C version of the
original Colossal Cave Text Adventure as a portable command-line
implementation built on Microsoft Windows.  The game is playable.  The
open-source implementation of the game is meant to be instructive.

Adv10 is the first-stage project for progressive development of enriched
versions, from the command-line to 3D animated versions.  The first stage
is creating an anatomy and reverse-engineering of the game presented in
\[[Knuth2011: Chapter 27](../bib/authors.htm#Knuth2011)\]
as a Literate Program \[[Knuth1992](../bib/authors.htm#Knuth1992)\].
