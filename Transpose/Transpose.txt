                      ADV10: LITERATE TO C TRANSPOSITION
                      ==================================

    This is the place for the careful transposition of advent.w to Clean C
    and text files.

MANIFEST

    Transpose.txt
        This description file on the construction and organization of
        the material.

    adv10.c
        The main source-code file for Adv10, initially a single C Language
        program derived by manually tangling advent.w with annotations.

    advent.w-to-adv10.c.txt
        This is a version of advent.w that is progressively scavenged to
        make expanded versions of adv10.c until there is a full working,
        compilable Clean C version.  As scavenging occurs, this file
        shrinks accordingly.

    words.c
        The vocabulary database and the procedures used to populate it
        on start-up
    words.h
        The header file for the word dictionary entries and the visible
        operations for accessing word definitions

TODO

 * Close Adv10/src as part of the development structure refactoring.

 * Provide more history and tie into the nfoTools materials.

 * Move material that does not have to be in adv10.c here instead of
   in-line in the adv10.c source.  Include general TDDO materials and
   other narratives.  There will still be considerable narrative in
   the source code.

 * Get to the first level of clean compilation for an executable null
   implementation.

 * Start clustering code in sections where types, functions, and definitions
   for key data structures are adjacent, so that there can be extractions
   and encapsulation at some point.

 * Tie adv10.c and advent.w (the transposition) to their GitHub/repo
   locations.
