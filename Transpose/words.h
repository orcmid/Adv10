 *
 *    The Vocabulary Database contains forms of all of the words that are
 *    recognized by the Adventure program.  In the current version, the
 *    words are fixed and the vocabulary is not extensible.
 *
 *    The vocabulary is in English language and the words consist of ASCII
 *    characters.  Case is ignored. Wwrds longer than 5 letters are reduced
 *    to the first 5 letters in the database.  The words are stored in
 *    lower-case form, regardless of the case of the input and the case used
 *    for the words in game messages.

        for an additional entry.
