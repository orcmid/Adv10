 *    The Vocabulary Database contains forms of all of the words that are
 *    recognized by the Adventure program.  In the current version, the
 *    words are fixed and the vocabulary is not extensible.
 *
 *    The vocabulary is in English language and the words consist of ASCII
 *    characters.  Case is ignored. Traditionally, words longer than 5 letters
 *    are reduced to the first 5 letters in the database.
