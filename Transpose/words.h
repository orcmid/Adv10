 *
 *    The Vocabulary Database contains forms of all of the words that are
 *    recognized by the Adventure program.  In the current version, the
 *    words are fixed and the vocabulary is not extensible.
 *
 *    The vocabulary is in English language and the words consist of ASCII
 *    characters.  Case is ignored. Wwrds longer than 5 letters are reduced
 *    to the first 5 letters in the database.  The words are stored in
 *    lower-case form, regardless of the case of the input and the case used
 *    for the words in game messages.

/*      Each word in the vocabulary database has a wordtype specified in
        its database entry.
           no_type is defined in [fg:27.5] but not used.
           Advent exploits no_type for determining when a slot in the
        vocabulary in empty.
           Adv10 also uses no_type when there is no room to add an entry
        and when a word is not in the vocabulary.

/*         The meaning value is one of the enumeration values associated with
        the given word_type.
           Advent uses the type name hashentry for this structure, saying
        more about the implementation than is needed for the API.
           For Adv10, the term wordentry is chosen to be more about purpose.
        Unsigned char types are used to avoid possible difficulties in the
        unlikely case that any of the values exceeds 127.
