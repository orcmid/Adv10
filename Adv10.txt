                              ADVENTURE VERSION 1.0
                              =====================
             <https://github.com/orcmid/Adv10/blob/master/Adv10.txt>

                   THE ORIGINAL COLOSSAL CAVE TEXT ADVENTURE

                  DEVELOPMENT AND SOURCE CODE VERSION CONTROL
                  -------------------------------------------

    This project is for development of a Clean C version of the
    original Colossal Cave Adventure as a portable command-line
    implementation.  Adv10 is the foundation of the Cavern project
    for progressive development of enriched versions, from command-
    line to 3D animated versions.

    Stable distributions of Adv10 executables are made available at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/Adv10/dev> when transposition to Clean C
    is completed.  There will also be release branches in the source
    code repository at <https://github.com/orcmid/Adv10>.

    To build and run Adv10 from this source code in its current state,
    you will need to use a desktop PC with Microsoft Windows and Visual
    Studio Build Tools.

    For more details about what you need to install to have Adv10
    build successfully, consult https://orcmid.github.io/Adv10

TODO

  * Re-organize along a nfoTools-consistent project structure, including
    adjusting text rulers and manifest/TODO files.  This will move source
    into dev.

  * Figure out how to get back to keeping the extractions from the *.w
    form to the *.c and *.h forms so that the derivations can be matched.

  * Add attribution.

  * In the source-code notices, and here, add statement about English being
    preserved as the authoritative content, with supplemental translations,
    rather than replacement translations. This is because development is in
    English and trouble-shooting is generally by English-fluent contributors.
    See below.

  * In the use of Adv10 at some level of release, when there is support for
    additional languages, it will always be possible to have dual-language
    presentation to aid in trouble-shooting and verification of operation.

  * Devise a scheme where the player's map location and the identification
    of the displayed text is provided in a consistent form in every output,
    although barely noticeable and not generally useful in the player's own
    mapmaking.  It is relevant in captured output and will be usable by
    game-exercising test fixtures.  Users will probably figure it out.

  * When there is audio, the background of each room should be distinctive,
    and there can be thematic nuances as well.

  * Seek out and/or develop a console library that provides something perhaps
    like ncurses and at least ANSI mode operation, but more abstracted.  This
    is just for output formatting and not so elevated as a CUA level (at
    least for 1.0.0, though a CUA version is ddesirable at some point too).

  * There needs to be a better roadmap with regard to progressions thrugh to
    CUA and all the supports for internationalization and accessibility.
    Being able to save and restore games is also important, as will be the
    ability to trace and script.  The prospect of animation is considered
    later. So long as it is the same game, we will have 1.x.y versions.  There
    might need to be reconsideration of that, and the adv10 name.

  * Add the injunction that one should play the adventure and then take a
    look at the code, also with a hat tip to advent.w, etc.

  * Add deployment-oriented organization that will be used in releasing beta
    and later versions of the Adv10 transposition.

  * Keep the README at a consistent high level, with details in supporting
    pages.

  * Report the opening, and the various notifications, to Don Knuth and Don
    Woods for their review and confirmation that their reservations are
    satisfied.

  * Set up command-line options for the adv10 executable too.  At least the
    unknown parameters, which is what "-?" will also always produce.

  * Tuck the permission mails and other hard copy materials into an off-line
    file folder.

  * Create a sequestered web-site folder for preserving copies of the source
    materials that I am basing this project on.

  * Deal with dependencies and the intermediate use of libraries under Adv10.

  * Cover toolcraft and the intention of relying exclusively on freely-
    available software tools and libraries.

  * At some point, using fixed lines will not work.  We will need to change
    to some form of automatic reflow.  It would be interesting if that would
    just take the current layout as hinting.

  * Working out reflow ultimately ties into localization and use of non-Roman
    texts.  Since there may be significant platform/library support for that,
    this will be an exercise related to the nfoWare Text topic and also the
    handling of platform and library dependencies that need to be somehow
    put under build control in a way that preserves the common source and the
    "reference" implementation.  There is much fodder here for some useful
    SE4E demonstration/consideration.

  * Now that it is appealed to here, get cracking on dev/WinCon/Adv10Run.bat
    and get a dev/WinCon that lets folks get builds and runs to happen from
    now on as part of continuous iteration.

   * For audio, look into environmental sounds.  For thoughts, see
    <https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/sugai-ken-the-shibui-of-field-recording-and-electronics/>

  * Replace nfoWare references to ones about GitHub orcmid/Adv10
